## 💡 Objection Handling

### "We're already using Excel/Google Sheets"
**Response:** "While spreadsheets work, they create 3 major problems: (1) No security/access control, (2) Prone to errors and data loss, (3) Time-consuming manual updates. Our system automates 80% of that work and provides better insights."

### "We can't afford it"
**Response:** "Let's look at the ROI. If your administrator spends 10 hours/week on manual tasks at $20/hour, that's $10,400/year. Our system costs $588-1,788/year and saves 15-20 hours/week. You'll save money while improving service."

### "We're too small"
**Response:** "Actually, small churches benefit most! You likely have limited staff, so automation is crucial. Our Starter plan is just $49/month—less than a coffee per day—and will save your volunteers countless hours."

### "We don't have IT staff"
**Response:** "That's exactly why we built the web installer and offer managed hosting. You can be up and running in 30 minutes with zero technical knowledge. Plus, we provide training and support."

### "What if we outgrow it?"
**Response:** "The system is designed to scale from 50 to 5,000+ members. Plus, because it's built on modern, open-source technology, you can always add custom features as needed."

### "We need [specific feature]"
**Response:** "Great question! Let me show you how our system handles that... [demonstrate]. If it's not currently available, we offer custom development starting at $5,000."
